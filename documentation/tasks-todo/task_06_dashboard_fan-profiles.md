# Task 06: Dashboard Fan Profiles with Interactive Curve Editor

## Task Overview
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED & ENHANCED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours  
**Actual Time**: ~10 hours (including major redesign and enhancements)  
**Completion Date**: 2025-09-11  
**Latest Update**: 2025-09-11 - Complete redesign with enhanced UX

## Issues Resolved

### Critical API Endpoint Issue (Initial Implementation)
During implementation, discovered and fixed a critical API endpoint configuration issue:
- **Problem**: Fan profiles API calls were failing with JSON parsing errors
- **Root Cause**: Frontend API calls were missing `/api` prefix in fan profile endpoints
- **Solution**: Updated all fan profile API endpoints from `/fan-profiles` to `/api/fan-profiles`
- **Files Fixed**: `frontend/src/services/fanProfilesApi.ts` (7 endpoint URLs corrected)
- **Verification**: Full API workflow tested and confirmed working

### Major UX Issues & Complete Redesign (Post-Launch)
After initial implementation, user feedback identified critical UX problems requiring a complete redesign:

#### Original Problems:
- **Complex drag-and-drop chart was un-editable and displayed incorrectly**
- **Curve scaling issues**: Graph compressed to tiny corner, wrong temperature ranges
- **Tooltip overflow**: Tooltips cut off at chart edges
- **Missing point removal**: No way to delete points from curves
- **Overwhelming interface**: Too many controls competing for attention

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Complete interface redesign**: New step-by-step "Enhanced Profile Builder" approach
- **Fixed curve scaling**: Proper 0-100¬∞C temperature range with correct grid lines
- **Smart tooltip positioning**: Prevents overflow with dynamic positioning
- **Multiple point interaction methods**: Right-click to remove, double-click line to add
- **Visual preset cards**: Large, interactive preset selection with descriptions
- **Progressive disclosure**: Step-by-step workflow reducing cognitive load

## Objective
Create a dedicated fan profile management page within the dashboard where users can create, edit, and manage custom fan profile graphs with interactive drag-and-drop curve editing functionality.

- `frontend/src/App.css`

**Changes:**
- Added tab navigation system with "Systems Monitor" and "Fan Profiles" tabs
- Implemented conditional rendering based on active tab
- Added professional tab styling with hover effects and active states

### 2. Complete Interface Redesign - "Enhanced Profile Builder"
**Files Major Rewrite:**
- `frontend/src/components/FanCurveChart.tsx` - Complete overhaul with multiple interaction methods
- `frontend/src/components/FanProfileEditor.tsx` - Redesigned as step-by-step workflow
- `frontend/src/App.css` - Added 200+ lines of new styling for enhanced UX

**New Step-by-Step Design:**

#### Step 1: Visual Preset Selection
- **Large interactive preset cards** with hover effects and animations
- **Silent** (üîá): Max 80%, prioritizes quiet operation
- **Balanced** (‚öñÔ∏è): Max 90%, good balance of cooling & noise  
- **Performance** (üöÄ): Max 100%, maximum cooling performance
- **Visual feedback**: Active states, descriptions, and performance stats

#### Step 2: Enhanced Interactive Chart
- **Fixed scaling**: Proper 0-100¬∞C temperature range with correct proportions
- **Multiple interaction methods**:
  - **Drag points**: Click and drag to adjust temperature/speed
  - **Double-click curve**: Add points anywhere on the curve line
  - **Right-click points**: Remove points (minimum 2 points protected)
- **Smart tooltips**: Dynamic positioning prevents overflow at chart edges
- **Professional styling**: Larger points (8px default, 12px on hover), better contrast
- **Real-time validation**: Automatic bounds checking and constraint handling

#### Step 3: Streamlined Profile Details
- **Moved to end of workflow**: Reduced cognitive load
- **Clean form layout**: Name, description, global setting
- **Focus on essentials**: Removed overwhelming technical details

### 3. Advanced Interaction System
**Multiple Point Management Methods:**
- **Add via button**: Traditional "Add Point" button for end-point addition
- **Add via double-click**: Double-click anywhere on curve line for precise placement
- **Remove via right-click**: Context menu approach for intuitive point removal
- **Drag to adjust**: Click and drag any point for real-time value adjustment

**Smart Tooltip System:**
- **Overflow prevention**: Dynamic positioning prevents tooltips from being cut off
- **Contextual content**: Shows temperature/speed values and removal instructions
- **Adaptive sizing**: Tooltips resize based on content (taller when showing removal hint)
- **Professional styling**: Enhanced contrast and typography for dark mode

**Visual Feedback Enhancements:**
- **Interactive cursors**: Crosshair on curve line, grab/grabbing on points
- **Smooth animations**: Hover effects, transitions, and visual state changes
- **Point sizing**: Larger interactive points (8px ‚Üí 12px on hover) for better usability
- **Chart information**: Real-time display of point count and active temperature range

```

#### Tab Navigation System
```typescript
type TabType = 'systems' | 'profiles';
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<TabType>('systems');

// Conditional rendering based on active tab
