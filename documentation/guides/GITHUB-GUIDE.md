## Repository Structure

Pankha uses a **two-repository architecture** to separate active development from stable releases.

### Development Repository: `pankha-dev`
**URL**: https://github.com/Anexgohan/pankha-dev

**Visibility**: **Private** (development team only)

**Purpose**: Active development, testing, and experimental features

**Local Directory**: `/root/anex/dev/pankha-dev/`

**Docker Configuration**:
```yml
# compose.yml in pankha-dev
services:
  pankha-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
```
- Builds locally from source code
- Tests Docker builds before release

**Characteristics**:
- Contains work-in-progress code
- Frequent commits with incremental changes
- May include experimental features
- Testing ground for new functionality
- Updated multiple times per day
- Private access only

**Use For**:
- Feature development
- Bug fixes
- Testing new ideas
- Documentation updates
- Development iterations
- Pre-release verification

---

### Production Repository: `pankha`
**URL**: https://github.com/Anexgohan/pankha

**Visibility**: **Public** (open source, community access)

**Description**: "central self hosted management of fans for all clients - release repo"

**Local Directory**: `/root/anex/dev/pankha/`

**Docker Configuration**:
```yml
# compose.yml in pankha
services:
  pankha-app:
    image: anexgohan/pankha:latest
```
- Pulls pre-built images from Docker Hub
- Ready for immediate deployment

**Characteristics**:
- Contains only stable, tested code
- Infrequent, versioned releases
- Production-ready deployments
- Public-facing stable releases
- Well-documented, tested features
- Open source community access

**Use For**:
- Stable releases
- Production deployments
- Public distribution
- Version-tagged releases
- Community contributions

---

## Development Workflow

### Standard Development Cycle (Automated)

With GitHub Actions, syncing to the public repository is **fully automated**:

```bash
# STEP 1: Work in Development Environment
cd /root/anex/dev/pankha-dev/

# Make code changes
# - Edit backend/frontend code
# - Update agent code
# - Write documentation

# STEP 2: Test Changes Locally
# Test backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Test frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev

# Test Docker build
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# STEP 3: Commit Changes
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

# STEP 4: Push to Development Repository
git push origin main

# ðŸŽ‰ AUTOMATIC: GitHub Actions triggers and:
# - Syncs code to pankha (public repo)
# - Excludes dev-specific files
# - Builds Docker image
# - Pushes to Docker Hub as anexgohan/pankha:latest
# - Takes 3-5 minutes

# STEP 5: Monitor (Optional)
# Watch at: https://github.com/Anexgohan/pankha-dev/actions
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. âœ… Code syncs from pankha-dev â†’ pankha
2. âœ… Dev files excluded (tasks-todo, samples, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
3. âœ… Public README applied
4. âœ… Docker Hub compose.yml applied
5. âœ… Docker image built and pushed
6. âœ… Community can pull `docker pull anexgohan/pankha:latest`

---

## Release Process (Automated)

### When to Release

With GitHub Actions, **every push to pankha-dev automatically releases to pankha**! However, you should still ensure:
- âœ… Feature is complete and tested
- âœ… All tests pass
- âœ… Documentation is updated
- âœ… No known critical bugs
- âœ… Code has been reviewed

### Automated Release Workflow

**The Simple Way (Recommended):**

```bash
# STEP 1: Test Your Changes
cd /root/anex/dev/pankha-dev/
npm run dev  # Test locally
docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d  # Test Docker

# STEP 2: Commit and Push
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature: description"
git push origin main

# ðŸŽ‰ DONE! GitHub Actions automatically:
# - Syncs to pankha (public repo)
# - Builds Docker image
# - Pushes to Docker Hub
# - Community can immediately use it

# STEP 3: Monitor the Release
# Watch at: https://github.com/Anexgohan/pankha-dev/actions
# Takes 3-5 minutes to complete

# STEP 4: Tag a Version (Optional)
# For major releases, create a version tag:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0 - Major release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**What Happens Automatically:**

```
You push â†’ GitHub Actions workflow triggers
    â†“
Sync files to pankha (with exclusions)
    â†“
Replace README.md with public version
    â†“
Replace compose.yml with Docker Hub version
    â†“
Commit to pankha with your message
    â†“
Build Docker image from Dockerfile
    â†“
Push to Docker Hub as anexgohan/pankha:latest
    â†“
âœ… Release complete!
```

**Manual Release (If Needed):**

If GitHub Actions is disabled or you need manual control:

```bash
# See task_13_github-action.md for manual sync instructions
# Or temporarily disable workflow and use rsync method
```

---

## Managing What Gets Synced (Exclusions)

### How to Control What's Public

All exclusions are managed in: **`.github/sync-exclude.txt`**

```bash
# Edit exclusions
cd /root/anex/dev/pankha-dev
nano .github/sync-exclude.txt

# Commit and push
git add .github/sync-exclude.txt
git commit -m "Update sync exclusions"
git push origin main

# Changes apply on next sync!
```

### Current Exclusions

Files/directories that **DO NOT** sync to pankha (public repo):

**Development Files:**
- `documentation/tasks-todo/` - Development tasks
- `samples/` - Sample/reference code
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development workflow guide
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent development notes
- `.github/` - GitHub workflows (public has its own)

**Special Handling:**
- `compose.yml` - **Replaced** with Docker Hub version
- `README.md` - **Replaced** with public README

**Security:**
- `.env*` - All environment files
- Agent config directories
- Database files
- Logs

### Add New Exclusion

```bash
# Keep a new folder private
echo "my-private-folder/" >> .github/sync-exclude.txt
git add .github/sync-exclude.txt
git commit -m "Exclude my-private-folder from public repo"
git push origin main
```

### Remove Exclusion (Make Public)

```bash
# Edit file and delete the line
nano .github/sync-exclude.txt
# Remove the line for what you want to make public
git add .github/sync-exclude.txt
git commit -m "Make samples/ public"
git push origin main
```

### Exclusion Patterns

```txt
# Directory (with trailing slash)
folder-name/

# Specific file
filename.txt

# Pattern matching
*.secret
*.draft

# Nested paths
path/to/file.txt
```

---

## Monitoring the Sync

### View Workflow Status

**GitHub UI:**
https://github.com/Anexgohan/pankha-dev/actions

**Check Latest Run:**
```bash
# View in browser
open https://github.com/Anexgohan/pankha-dev/actions

# Or check via API
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_PAT" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/Anexgohan/pankha-dev/actions/runs?per_page=1"
```

### Verify Sync Succeeded

```bash
# Check pankha repo has latest code
cd /root/anex/dev/pankha
git pull origin main
git log -1  # Should show your commit message

# Check Docker Hub has new image
docker pull anexgohan/pankha:latest

# Verify exclusions worked
ls documentation/tasks-todo/  # Should NOT exist in pankha
ls samples/                   # Should NOT exist in pankha
```

### Troubleshooting

**Workflow Failed:**
1. Check logs: https://github.com/Anexgohan/pankha-dev/actions
2. Verify secrets are configured correctly
3. Check task_13_github-action.md for detailed troubleshooting

**Sync Not Happening:**
- Ensure workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/sync-to-public.yml`
- Check workflow is enabled in GitHub Actions tab
- Verify pushing to `main` branch (not other branches)

**Wrong Files Synced:**
- Check `.github/sync-exclude.txt`
- Remember: Changes apply on **next** push, not retroactively

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages

**Format**:
```
Brief summary (50 chars or less)

Detailed explanation of changes:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Any breaking changes
- Related issue numbers
```

**Good Examples**:
```
Add production Linux agent with real hardware integration

- Implemented sensor discovery for k10temp, it8628, nvme
- Added PWM fan control with RPM feedback
- WebSocket bidirectional communication
- Tested on AMD Ryzen 9 3900X (25 sensors, 5 fans)
```

```
Fix dropdown auto-closing during real-time updates

- Prevent dropdowns from closing when state updates
- Maintain dropdown state using refs
- Resolves issue #123
```

**Bad Examples**:
```
fix bug          # Too vague
Updated files    # What files? Why?
WIP             # Never commit work-in-progress to main
```

---

### Branching Strategy

**Development Repository (pankha-dev)**:
- **main**: Active development branch
- Feature branches: Optional for major features
```bash
git checkout -b feature/fan-profiles
# Work on feature
git checkout main
git merge feature/fan-profiles
git push origin main
```

**Production Repository (pankha)**:
- **main**: Stable releases only
- **No feature branches**: Only merge tested, stable code

---

### What NOT to Commit

#### Never Commit:
```bash
# Sensitive data
.env
*.key
*.pem
credentials.json
config/secrets.json

# Database files
backend/database/postgres_data/
*.sql  # (unless it's migration scripts)

# Dependencies
node_modules/
venv/
__pycache__/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.log

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
```

#### Verify Before Pushing:
```bash
# Check what's staged
git status

# Review changes
git diff --cached

# Check for sensitive data
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" --include="*.json" --include="*.env"
```

---

### Security Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:
- [ ] No passwords or API keys in code
- [ ] No database credentials
- [ ] No production .env files
- [ ] No sensitive user data
- [ ] .gitignore is up to date
- [ ] Database files excluded (postgres_data/)

## Troubleshooting

### Push Rejected (Large Files)
```bash
# Error: File exceeds GitHub's 100MB limit
# Solution: Ensure postgres_data/ is in .gitignore

# Check .gitignore
cat .gitignore | grep postgres_data

# Remove from staging if accidentally added
git reset backend/database/postgres_data/

# Force remove from history (if already committed)
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf backend/database/postgres_data' HEAD
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# If conflicts occur during cherry-pick or merge
git status  # View conflicted files

# Edit conflicted files manually, then:
git add path/to/resolved-file
git cherry-pick --continue
# or
git merge --continue
```

### Undo Last Commit (Not Pushed)
```bash
# Keep changes, undo commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard changes and commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Undo Pushed Commit
```bash
# Create revert commit (safe, recommended)
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Force push (dangerous, avoid on shared repos)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force origin main
```
