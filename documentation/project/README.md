## Getting Started

### For System Administrators
1. Start with **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** to understand the system design
2. Follow **[backend/build-instructions.md](./backend/build-instructions.md)** to deploy the backend
3. Use **[AGENT-DEPLOYMENT.md](./AGENT-DEPLOYMENT.md)** to install agents on target systems

### For End Users
1. Review **[USER-WORKFLOWS.md](./USER-WORKFLOWS.md)** for interface usage
2. Access the web interface at your deployment URL
3. Follow the workflow guides for common tasks

### For Developers
1. Read **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** for system understanding
2. Check **[PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md)** for current implementation status
3. Review task documentation for implementation details

## System Overview

Pankha is a distributed fan control system consisting of:

- **Central Backend**: Docker-containerized Node.js/TypeScript server with PostgreSQL database
- **Distributed Agents**: Python-based hardware monitoring agents deployable on any system
- **Web Frontend**: React-based user interface for monitoring and control

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Real-time temperature monitoring across multiple systems
- ‚úÖ Centralized fan control with custom profiles
- ‚úÖ WebSocket-based real-time communication
- ‚úÖ Safety mechanisms and emergency controls
- ‚úÖ Scalable architecture supporting unlimited agents
- ‚úÖ Web-based management interface

### Current Deployment
- **Backend**: http://192.168.100.237:3000 (Production Docker)
- **Development**: Linux server at 192.168.100.237 (/root/anex/dev/pankha-dev)
- **Test Agent**: Mock agent successfully connected and operational

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- `README.md` - Directory overview and navigation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and design
- `[COMPONENT]-[PURPOSE].md` - Specific component documentation
- Task files: `task_[number].md`

### Content Structure
Each documentation file follows this structure:
1. **Overview** - Purpose and scope
2. **Main Content** - Detailed information organized by sections
3. **Examples** - Code samples, configurations, or procedures
4. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
5. **References** - Related documentation and external resources

### Maintenance
Documentation is maintained alongside code changes:
- Update documentation when features are added or modified
- Keep examples and configurations current
- Regular review for accuracy and completeness

## Support and Contributing

### Getting Help
- Review troubleshooting sections in relevant documentation
- Check system logs and diagnostic tools
- Consult the architecture documentation for system understanding

### Contributing to Documentation
- Follow the established structure and naming conventions
- Include practical examples and use cases
- Update related documentation when making changes
